**Estimating Agricultural Dependent Populations in India**\
The figures below comprise part of my MSc dissertation, using remote sensing and spatial disaggregation to estimate agricultural dependence in the population at a small area scale. This project involved 2 stages, (1) testing proof-of-concept on a subregion, the state of Karnataka in Western India, and (2) scaling up the analytical process to produce estimates for the whole of India.

**Extended urbanisation in the Gauteng City Region**\
The Gauteng City-Region comprises the combined metropolis of Johannesburg, Pretoria, and surrounds, and forms the largest urban agglomeration in South Africa. In this project, I worked with the [Gauteng City Region Observatory](https://www.gcro.ac.za/) to explore the spatial dimensions emerging from Quality of Life survey data, with a specific focus on peripheral settlements.

The project investigated dimensions of gendered travel across the region, commuting
