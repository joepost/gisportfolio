**Estimating Agricultural Dependent Populations in India**  
The figures below comprise part of my MSc dissertation, using remote sensing and spatial disaggregation to estimate agricultural dependence in the population at a small area scale. This project involved 2 stages, (1) testing proof-of-concept on a subregion, the state of Karnataka in Western India, and (2) scaling up the analytical process to produce estimates for the whole of India.
