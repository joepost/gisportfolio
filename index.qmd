**Who am I?**\
I am a spatial data analyst interested in urban systems, remote sensing, spatial epidemiology, and data development. Currently, I work in First Nations Health with the [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)](https://www.aihw.gov.au/). I am based in London, UK.

**What is this?**\
This is a GIS portfolio of some of my previous work, with examples of projects completed throughout professional roles, personal pursuits, and as part of my MSc in Urban Spatial Science at UCL Bartlett.
