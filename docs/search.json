This project involved 2 stages, (1) testing proof-of-concept on a subregion, the state of Karnataka in Western India, and (2) scaling up the analytical process to produce estimates for the whole of India. Analysis has been performed in Python, Google Earth Engine, and QGIS.\nFigures a–c are visualisations of the input datasets used in the population disaggregation model: the WorldPop gridded population count, GHSL Settlement Model Grid (GHS-SMOD), and DynamicWorld-derived cropland cover, respetively. Figure d shows the output of the model.\n\n\n\nKarnataka sub-region maps\n\n\nFigures e and f provide a reference for the study region, India and the state of Karnataka.\n\n\n\nIndia reference maps"

In this project, I worked with the Gauteng City Region Observatory to explore the spatial dimensions emerging from Quality of Life survey data, with a specific focus on peripheral settlements. The work was published as part of the GCRO’s ‘Map of the Month Series’, and the full report can be found here.\nThe project investigated dimensions of gendered travel across the region, commuting distance, and sense of belonging. The figure below examines respondents in peripheral communities who consider this neighbourhood as their ‘home’. The significance of belonging is an indicator of patterns of rural-to-urban migration from throughout South Africa, and the phenomenon of urban migrants maintaining a connection with their rural origins, including continued investment in a rural home at the expense of urban quality of life. This work was completed as part of a field course organised by the UCL Urban Lab.\n\n\n\nGCRO Map of the month"
