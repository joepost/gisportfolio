Currently, I work in First Nations Health with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). I am based in London, UK.\nWhat is this? This is a GIS portfolio of my previous work, with examples of projects completed throughout professional work and as part of my MSc in Urban Spatial Science, at UCL Bartlett. I’ve designed this website to accompany my application to McGregor Coxall’s Biourbanism Lab.\nPlease navigate through the tabs to view static work, interactive apps, my resume, and contact details for further information.\nThis website has been authored in reproducible markdown using Quarto open-source software and RStudio, published via Github Pages."

This project involved 2 stages, (1) testing proof-of-concept on a subregion, the state of Karnataka in Western India, and (2) scaling up the analytical process to produce estimates for the whole of India.\nFigures a–c are visualisations of the input datasets used in the population disaggregation model. Figure d shows the output of the model.\n\n\n\nKarnataka sub-region maps\n\n\nFigures e and f provide a reference for the study region, Karnataka and India.\n\n\n\nIndia reference maps"

In this project, I worked with the Gauteng City Region Observatory to explore the spatial dimensions emerging from Quality of Life survey data, with a specific focus on peripheral settlements. The work was published as part of the GCRO’s ‘Map of the Month Series’, and the full report can be found here.\nThe project investigated dimensions of gendered travel across the region, commuting distance, and sense of belonging. This work was completed as part of a field course organised by the UCL Urban Lab.\n\n\n\nGCRO Map of the month"
